TSO is a scheduling tool written in Python for use by astronomical researchers in order to consider a wide variety of constraints and attempt to produce an optimal observation schedule.

## Getting Started

## Useful Tools

- `conda` - https://conda.io/miniconda.html (useful in managing multiple python environments)

### Conda

In this repository there is an `environment.yml` file that contains information about the dependencies required by this project. It also specifies `tso` as the name of the environment.

#### Creating a New Environment in Conda From an `environment.yml` File

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

#### Switching Environments Created Using Conda

**MacOS/Linux**
```
source activate tso
```
**Windows**
```
activate tso
```
